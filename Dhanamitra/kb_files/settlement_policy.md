# Settlement Policy (OTS)

**1. Eligibility for Settlement**
One-Time Settlement (OTS) options are strictly reserved for loans that are classified as **NPA (Non-Performing Asset)**, meaning they are more than **90 days overdue**.

**2. Penalty Waivers**
If you clear the Principal Amount in a single payment today, we can waive **100%** of the accumulated late fees and cheque bouncing charges.

**3. Principal Discount**
* **General Rule:** We do not offer discounts on the principal amount.
* **Exceptions:** In rare cases, a maximum discount of 15-20% on the total outstanding may be approved, subject to immediate payment.

**4. Credit Score Impact**
* **Warning:** Accepting a settlement will mark your loan as **"Settled"** instead of "Closed" on your CIBIL report. This negative status stays on your record for years and may prevent you from getting future loans or credit cards.
